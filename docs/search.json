    "text": "Product Family Selection is Essential to the Success of S&OP\nSales & Operations Planning (S&OP) is, at its core, a monthly business planning process driven by a forecast. This forecast serves as the foundation for all subsequent planning activities, shaping decisions across multiple departments—from Sales and Finance to Supply Chain and Operations. However, each department views the business through a unique lens, shaped by their specific challenges and objectives. Sales focuses on market trends and customer demand, Operations prioritizes efficiency and resource allocation, Finance looks at profitability and risk, and Supply Chain balances inventory and supplier constraints.\nBecause of these diverse perspectives, forecasts must be structured at an aggregated level that allows meaningful analysis across all functions. Choosing the right level of aggregation—and, more specifically, the right product families—is essential for ensuring forecasts can pivot in ways that make them useful for different teams. The grouping strategy depends on several factors unique to each organization, such as computing resources, demand patterns, product portfolio complexity, and the time available to conduct S&OP meetings.\nA well-structured forecast doesn't just serve individual departments—it creates a shared language that fosters engagement across the entire organization. If product families are defined in a way that resonates with all stakeholders, S&OP meetings become more productive, collaboration strengthens, and strategic decisions become more aligned. Additionally, selecting product families wisely can have a direct impact on forecast model selection and accuracy, ensuring demand planning methodologies generate meaningful insights.\nLessons from My First S&OP Implementation\nI learned this firsthand when transitioning from a Kitting Production Manager role into my company's first Demand Planner position in 2015. At the time, I was mostly handling purchase order planning, but I envisioned expanding the role into something more strategic.\nBy 2016, I convinced leadership to send me to the APICS S&OP conference in Chicago, where I immersed myself in best practices and earned my certification. With this knowledge, I led a team—including members from Supply Chain, IT, and Sales—to design a simple but effective S&OP pilot program. Over time, the program matured into an integral part of our operations.\nWhile we faced plenty of challenges along the way—adjusting processes, refining methodologies, and learning through trial and error—one realization stood above the rest:\n\"It's all in the product families.\"\nThis simple yet profound statement came from our IT lead, Joe, and became the most valuable insight I took with me into future S&OP initiatives.\n\n\nsurprisingly, many companies underestimate the significance of product families when designing their S&OP process. A well-defined product family structure enhances forecasting by providing clarity in discussions and allowing different departments to engage meaningfully.\nFundamentals of Demand Planning and Forecasting (Chaman L. Jain, St. John's University) underscores this point, stating: \"Concentrate on overall product families, not on SKUs: it would be difficult to accomplish much in a meeting if we start discussing SKUs... Therefore, it is important to confine the overall discussion to overall volume and families/categories.\" This perspective is crucial—S&OP meetings should drive strategic alignment, and defining product families at the right level ensures discussions remain actionable without getting lost in excessive detail.\nBuilding on this idea, Sales & Operations Planning: The How-To Handbook (Wallace & Stahl) emphasizes that product families should be structured based on market needs—typically guided by the Sales team—and recommends limiting the number of families to 6–12. My experience confirms this approach; when product families are aligned with market perspectives, they remain relevant for forecasting and planning discussions. However, I would extend this idea further:\nWhile market segmentation is essential, the most effective product families are those structured around how customers naturally engage with your products and services. Understanding how customers discover, discuss, and evaluate offerings provides a foundation for not only internal alignment but also external forecasting insights. Moreover, defining product families effectively enhances forecasting accuracy by improving model selection. When product families are logically structured, forecasting models can better recognize demand signals, increasing confidence in predictions and driving more informed planning decisions.\n\n\n\nSeeking clarity, I turned to the company's website and analyzed how customers navigated its product categories. Right there in the menu was the answer—eight distinct groups representing our core product families. This structure had been hiding in plain sight.\nWith that realization, we translated it into a formal proposal, mapped SKUs accordingly, and aligned forecasting methodologies. The transition took effort, particularly from Engineering, but ultimately led to significant improvements: ✅ Sales engagement increased—teams could easily interpret forecasts and connect them to actual customer conversations. ✅ S&OP discussions became more effective, particularly around pipeline forecasting. ✅ Forecasting models improved, integrating market-aligned product categories.\nThe biggest lesson? The best product family structures aren't dictated by internal complexity. They should reflect how the outside world perceives and engages with your products.\n\n\n\nSelecting the right product families doesn't just make forecasting easier—it unlocks higher-level capabilities such as demand sensing and machine learning-driven insights.\nFor some businesses, determining product families might seem straightforward—especially when dealing with consumer goods, where natural product categories are well-established and easily recognized. However, for companies offering unique, niche, or diverse product portfolios, defining product families becomes a foundational step in strategic planning and organizational alignment. In these cases, selecting the right families ensures that forecasts are structured effectively, discussions across departments remain cohesive, and planning decisions are made with clarity.\nFor small to midsized businesses interested in adopting S&OP, this decision is critical. Before investing in an expensive ERP system or building a full-scale planning department, companies must ensure their forecasting framework is built on product families that resonate with the market.\nThe ability to structure product families correctly also plays a critical role in forecasting accuracy. By aligning product groups with natural demand behaviors, organizations can refine their forecasting models, making predictions more reliable and useful for strategic planning.\nIn future posts, I'll dive deeper into forecast modeling strategies—examining how different models work, when to use them, and how businesses can enhance accuracy through better segmentation.\nS&OP success hinges on clarity, alignment, and engagement. And it all starts with how you define your product families.\nReferences:\nWallace, T., & Stahl, R. (2008). Sales & Operations Planning: The How-To Handbook (3rd ed.).\nJain, C. L. (2017).

    "text": "About me:\nSince 2014, I've been immersed in the world of Demand Planning. My journey began at a small electronics distributor and circuit board manufacturer, where I wore many hats. As part of the Purchasing department, my primary focus was writing and scheduling purchase orders. Over time, I evolved my role into a true Demand Planner position, leading the implementation of a Sales & Operations Planning (S&OP) program—a transformative project I'll dive deeper into in a future post.\nThis experience opened doors to a similar role at a larger electronics company, where I contributed to a variety of planning-related projects across multiple areas of the business. It was here that my technical skills grew rapidly, enabling me to tackle challenges in inventory optimization, product segmentation, risk assessment, and forecasting. My curiosity led me deeper into the realms of data modeling, automation, simulation, and comprehensive analysis, which further fueled my interest in technology and advanced data science techniques.\nAt one point, I found myself torn between two worlds—the intricate demands of Data Science and the specialized focus of Demand Planning. After much reflection, I decided to refocus my career on Demand Planning, taking a hands-on approach to developing the systems and analytics that are essential not just for planning activities but for the broader S&OP process as well.\nThis renewed perspective has sparked an insatiable drive to research complex time series forecasting techniques, test innovative ideas, and push the boundaries of what's possible. My mission is twofold: to contribute meaningful insights to my organization while also advancing the broader field of Demand Planning.\nAnd that's where this blog comes in. Here, I'll share my experiences, explore my opinions on literature and theory, and delve into the specifics of my current projects. My hope is to foster dialogue, gather feedback, and connect with professionals who share my passion for Demand Planning and forecasting\nMost importantly, I want this space to inspire others to challenge the status quo. Together, we can reimagine and reshape the future of this dynamic industry.\nThank you for stopping by. Stay curious, and let's grow together!\nRichard"
